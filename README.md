A repository for code, simple triggers and tools that may be helpful. :seedling:

Script will need to access credentials and may need to be rerun periodically.

--------

### Run with:
 *  `python3 script_of_interest.py`

--------


Functional notes:


    1. You will need a API Key for the accounts you are accessing.

    2. Scripts are built to be used infrequently. If you wish to scale their use please observe rate limits.

    3. Do not use any of the code I have written with harmful intent.

    4. By using this code you accept that every person has the right to choose their own gender identity.
